# Where was ChatGPT used?
ChatGPT was used quite often in this assignment. Particularly, API handling code created by ChatGPT. This would include the API error checking functions. ChatGPT also assisted in fixing the pagination buttons and having it access the API further. I also used it for the SCSS towards the end of the project, so that it'd be faster to just copy and paste the CSS chunk rather than finding each individual part & adding a line or two of CSS. Apart from this,  it was mainly used for error checking.
